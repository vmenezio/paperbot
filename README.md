# PaperBot

Personal newsletter droid

## Introduction

PaperBot is an automated newsletter bot, designed to help organize all the stuff you really want to read but just can't right now.

This droid will save interesting articles and blogs you come across during your college lectures or office hours, compile them into a beautiful newsletter and email them back to you later, when you can enjoy them in peace.

## Usage

Coming soon.
